The Window Class
------------------
Every program requires an instantiation of the :class:`Window` class. This class handles the OS dependencies for you and provides a way to inject your game loop through a decorator.

.. code:: py

   window = Window(resolution: Union[Tuple[int, int], AsciiPy.values.Resolutions], max_framerate: Optional[int] = None)

It will raise an error if the signature is incorrect anyways.
The function should accept at least one parameter that is of type :class:`Displayable`.
This parameter provides all accessible methods to the screen.
The game loop should consist of all the code to be processed internally with the context of the screen.
